name: Make FolderPath Vogon Poetry
description: |
  This is a completely stupid and pointless query that makes Vogon poetry out
  of a random FolderPath from the table you pass it.  You can change
  DeviceProcessEvents for any table as long as it has a column named DeviceName
  and a column called FolderPath.  Feel free to check in more verses :)
  Don't know what Vogon poetry is?  You have a research assignment: http://tinyurl.com/y8ueqchl
