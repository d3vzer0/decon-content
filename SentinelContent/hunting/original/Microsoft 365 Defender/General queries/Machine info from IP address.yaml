name: Machine info from IP address
description: |
  The following queries pivot from an IP address assigned to a machine to the relevant machine or logged-on users.

  Query #1: get machines that have used a given local IP address at a given time - as configured on their network adapters.
requiredDataConnectors:
- connectorId: MicrosoftThreatProtection
  dataTypes:
  - DeviceNetworkInfo
query: |
  let pivotTimeParam = datetime(2018-07-15 19:51:00);
  let ipAddressParam = "192.168.1.5";
  DeviceNetworkInfo
  | where Timestamp between ((pivotTimeParam-15m) ..30m) and IPAddresses contains strcat("\"", ipAddressParam, "\"") and NetworkAdapterStatus == "Up"
  //// Optional - add filters to make sure machine is part of the relevant network (and not using that IP address as part of another private network).
  //// For example:
  // and ConnectedNetworks contains "corp.contoso.com"
  // and IPv4Dhcp == "10.164.3.12"
  // and DefaultGateways contains "\"10.164.3.1\""
  | project DeviceName, Timestamp, IPAddresses, TimeDifference=abs(Timestamp-pivotTimeParam)
  // In case multiple machines have reported from that IP address arround that time, start with the ones reporting closest to pivotTimeParam
  | sort by TimeDifference asc
