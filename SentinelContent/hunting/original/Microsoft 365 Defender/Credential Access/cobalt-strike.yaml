  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Ransomware continues to hit healthcare, critical services. There is also a related blog.
  In April of 2020, security researchers observed multiple ransomware campaigns using the same set of techniques. The attackers would compromise a web-facing endpoint and employ tools such as Cobalt Strike to steal users' credentials.
  Cobalt Strike is commercial software used to conduct simulated threat campaigns against a target; however, malicious actors also use Cobalt Strike in real attacks. The software has a large range of capabilities, including credential theft.
  The following query identifies accounts that have logged on to compromised endpoints and have potentially had their credentials stolen.
