description: |
  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Ransomware continues to hit healthcare, critical services.
  It finds all user accounts that have logged on to an endpoint affected by Cobalt Strike, a penetration tool.
  Assume that all credentials on endpoints affected by Cobalt Strike were available to attackers and that all associated accounts are compromised. Note that attackers will not only dump credentials for accounts that have logged on to interactive or RDP sessions, but will also dump cached credentials and passwords for service accounts and scheduled tasks that are stored in the LSA Secrets section of the registry.
