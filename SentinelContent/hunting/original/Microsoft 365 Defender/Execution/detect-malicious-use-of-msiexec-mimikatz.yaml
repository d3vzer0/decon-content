  This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, Msiexec abuse.
  Msiexec.exe is a Windows component that installs files with the .msi extension. These kinds of files are Windows installer packages, and are used by a wide array of legitimate software. However, malicious actors can re-purpose msiexec.exe for living-off-the-land attacks, where they use legitimate system binaries on the compromised device to perform attacks.
  The following query detects activity associated with misuse of msiexec.exe, particularly alongside mimikatz, a common credential dumper and privilege escalation tool.
