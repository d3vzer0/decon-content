name: Azure Storage Mass File Deletion
description: |
  'Detect mass file deletion events within Azure File and Blob storage. deleteWindow controls
  the period of time the deletions must occur in, whilst the deleteThreshold controls how many files
  must be deleted within that threshold. Query works on a per-IP address basis, so will only detect a single
  IP deleting multiple files.'
