  Oftentimes organizations enable this rule in audit mode and check the results before setting block mode.
  You can use query #2 to measure the rule impact on your network in audit mode before turning it to block mode.
  Query #1 is used after setting it to block mode - to analyze the block stats.
  Tags: #ASR.
