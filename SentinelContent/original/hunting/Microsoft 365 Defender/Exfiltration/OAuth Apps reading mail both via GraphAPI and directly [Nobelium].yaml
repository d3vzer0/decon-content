name: OAuth Apps reading mail both via GraphAPI and directly [Nobelium]
description: |
  As described in previous guidance, Nobelium may re-purpose legitimate existing OAuth Applications in the environment to their own ends. However, malicious activity patterns may be discernable from  legitimate ones.
  The following query returns OAuth Applications that access mail both directly and via Graph, allowing review of whether such dual access methods follow expected use patterns.
