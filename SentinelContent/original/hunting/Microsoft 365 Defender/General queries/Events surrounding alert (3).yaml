name: Events surrounding alert (3)
description: |
  This query looks for events that are near in time to a detected event.
  It shows how you could avoid typing exact timestamps, and replace it with a simple query to get the timestamp of your pivot event (e.g. a detected event).
  This is useful when you have queries that you run often - e.g. as part of your regular investigation of an alert.
  Original query: filter for network logon events right before some timestamp.

  // Modified query: instead of copy-pasting the timestamp, get the timestamp of some event you can filter
  // In this example, take the time of the first detected event in an alert.
  // We filter on alertId - which you can get from all our APIs (SIEM, Graph API, PowerBI, DeviceAlertEvents table) or from the UI (the last part of the link to the alert page)
