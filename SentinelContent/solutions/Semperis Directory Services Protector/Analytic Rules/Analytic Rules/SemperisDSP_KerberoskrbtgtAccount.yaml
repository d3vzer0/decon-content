description: |
  'The krbtgt user account is a special (disabled) user account in every Active Directory domain that has a special role in Kerberos function. If this account's password is compromised, Golden Ticket attacks can be performed to get access to any resource in the AD domain. This indicator looks for a krbtgt user account whose password hasn't been changed in the past 180 days. While Microsoft recommends changing the password every year, STIG recommends changing it every 180 days.'
