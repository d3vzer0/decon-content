name: Detect DNS queries reporting multiple errors from different clients - Static threshold based (ASIM DNS Solution)
description: |
  'This rule creates an alert when multiple clients report errors for the same DNS query. This helps in identifying possible similar C2 communications originating from different clients. It utilizes [ASIM](https://aka.ms/AboutASIM) normalization and is applied to any source that supports the ASIM DNS schema.'
