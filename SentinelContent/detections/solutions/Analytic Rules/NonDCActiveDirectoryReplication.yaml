name: Non Domain Controller Active Directory Replication
description: |
  'This query detects potential attempts by non-computer accounts (non domain controllers) to retrieve/synchronize an active directory object leveraging directory replication services (DRS).
  A Domain Controller (computer account) would usually be performing these actions in a domain environment. Another detection rule can be created to cover domain controllers accounts doing at rare times.
  A domain user with privileged permissions to use directory replication services is rare. Ref: https://threathunterplaybook.com/notebooks/windows/06_credential_access/WIN-180815210510.html'
