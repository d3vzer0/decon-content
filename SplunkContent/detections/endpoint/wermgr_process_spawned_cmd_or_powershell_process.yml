description: This search is designed to detect suspicious cmd and powershell process
  spawned by wermgr.exe process. This suspicious behavior are commonly seen in code
  injection technique technique like trickbot to execute a shellcode, dll modules
  to run malicious behavior.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as cmdline
  min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where Processes.parent_process_name = "wermgr.exe" `process_cmd` OR `process_powershell`
  by Processes.parent_process_name  Processes.original_file_name Processes.parent_process_id  Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.process_guid Processes.dest Processes.user
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `wermgr_process_spawned_cmd_or_powershell_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
