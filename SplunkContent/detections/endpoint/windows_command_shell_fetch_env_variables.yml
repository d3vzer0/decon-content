description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process command line fetching
  the environment variables with a non-shell parent process. This technique was seen
  in qakbot malware where it fetches the environment variable in the target or compromised
  host. This TTP detection is a good pivot of possible malicious behavior since the
  command line is executed by a common non-shell process like cmd.exe , powershell.exe
  and many more. This can also be a good sign that the parent process has a malicious
  code injected to it to execute this command.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process = "*cmd /c
  set" OR Processes.process = "*cmd.exe /c set" AND NOT (Processes.parent_process_name
  = "cmd.exe" OR Processes.parent_process_name = "powershell*" OR Processes.parent_process_name="pwsh.exe"
  OR Processes.parent_process_name = "explorer.exe") by Processes.dest Processes.user

  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_command_shell_fetch_env_variables_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: shell process that are not included in this search may cause
  False positive. Filter is needed.
