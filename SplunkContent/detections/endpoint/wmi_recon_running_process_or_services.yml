status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious PowerShell script execution
  via EventCode 4104, where WMI is performing an event query looking for running processes
  or running services. This technique is commonly found in malware and APT events
  where the adversary will map all running security applications or services on the
  compromised machine. During triage, review parallel processes within the same timeframe.
  Review the full script block to identify other related artifacts.
data_source:
- Powershell 4104
search: '`powershell` EventCode=4104 ScriptBlockText= "*SELECT*" AND (ScriptBlockText="*Win32_Process*"
  OR ScriptBlockText="*Win32_Service*") | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime by EventCode ScriptBlockText Computer UserID | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmi_recon_running_process_or_services_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
