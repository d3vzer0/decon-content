description: This analytic identifies the use of "remotesigned" execution policy for a file. 
  This security setting determines whether PowerShell scripts can be executed on a computer. 
  When the execution policy is set to "remotesigned," it allows locally created scripts to run without any restrictions, 
  but scripts downloaded from the internet must have a digital signature from a trusted publisher.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this analytic, you will need to enable
  PowerShell Script Block Logging on some or all endpoints. Additional setup here
  https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/UBA/5.0.4.1/GetDataIn/AddPowerShell#Configure_module_logging_for_PowerShell.
known_false_positives: It is possible administrators or scripts may run these commands,
  filtering may be required.
