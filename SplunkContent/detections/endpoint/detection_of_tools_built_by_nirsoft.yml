status: experimental
type: TTP
description: This search looks for specific command-line arguments that may indicate
  the execution of tools made by Nirsoft, which are legitimate, but may be abused
  by attackers.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) values(Processes.process)
  as process max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where (Processes.process="*
  /stext *" OR Processes.process="* /scomma *" ) by Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.user | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `detection_of_tools_built_by_nirsoft_filter`'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: While legitimate, these NirSoft tools are prone to abuse. You
  should verfiy that the tool was used for a legitimate purpose.
