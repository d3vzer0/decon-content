description: In computing, Puppet is a software configuration management tool which
  includes its own declarative language to describe system configuration. It is a
  model-driven solution that requires limited programming knowledge to use. If sudo
  right is given to the tool for the user, then the user can run system commands as
  root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*puppet*"
  AND Processes.process="*apply*" AND Processes.process="*-e*" AND Processes.process="*exec*"
  AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_puppet_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
