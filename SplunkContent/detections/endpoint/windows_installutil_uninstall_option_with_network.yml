description: 'The following analytic identifies the Windows InstallUtil.exe binary
  making a remote network connection. This technique may be used to download and execute
  code while bypassing application control using the `/u` (uninstall) switch. \

  InstallUtil uses the functions install and uninstall within the System.Configuration.Install
  namespace to process .net assembly. Install function requires admin privileges,
  however, uninstall function can be run as an unprivileged user.\

  When `InstallUtil.exe` is used in a malicous manner, the path to an executable on
  the filesystem is typically specified. Take note of the parent process. In a suspicious
  instance, this will be spawned from a non-standard process like `Cmd.exe`, `PowerShell.exe`
  or `Explorer.exe`. \

  If used by a developer, typically this will be found with multiple command-line
  switches/arguments and spawn from Visual Studio. \

  During triage review resulting network connections, file modifications, and parallel
  processes. Capture any artifacts and review further.'

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Ports` node.
  In addition, confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest
  TA for the endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives should be present as InstallUtil is
  not typically used to download remote files. Filter as needed based on Developers
  requirements.
