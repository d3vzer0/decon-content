description: This analytic aims to identify potential adversaries who manipulate the security permissions of specific files or directories. 
  This technique is frequently observed in the tradecraft of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) and coinminer scripts. 
  By modifying the security permissions, adversaries seek to evade detection and impede access to their component files. 
  Such actions indicate a deliberate effort to maintain control over compromised systems and hinder investigation or remediation efforts. 
  Detecting these security permission changes can serve as a valuable indicator of an ongoing attack and enable timely response to mitigate the impact of the adversary's activities.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed icacls.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible some administrative scripts use ICacls.
  Filter as needed.
