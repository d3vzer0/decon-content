description: sqlite3 is a terminal-based front-end to the SQLite library that can
  evaluate queries interactively and display the results in multiple formats. sqlite3
  can also be used within shell scripts and other applications to provide batch processing
  features. If sudo right is given to this application for the user, then the user
  can run system commands as root and possibly get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*sqlite3*"
  AND Processes.process="*.shell*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_sqlite3_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
