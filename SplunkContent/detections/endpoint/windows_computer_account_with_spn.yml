type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies two SPNs, HOST and RestrictedKrbHost,
  added using the KrbRelayUp behavior. This particular behavior has been found in
  other Kerberos based attacks.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4741
search: '`wineventlog_security` EventCode=4741 MSADChangedAttributes IN ("*HOST/*","*RestrictedKrbHost/*")
  AND New_UAC_Value=0x80 | eval Effecting_Account=mvindex(Security_ID,1) | eval New_Computer_Account_Name=mvindex(Security_ID,0)
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime values(EventCode),values(Account_Domain),values(Security_ID),
  values(Effecting_Account), values(New_Computer_Account_Name),values(SAM_Account_Name),values(DNS_Host_Name),values(MSADChangedAttributes)
  by dest Logon_ID subject | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_computer_account_with_spn_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  Windows Security Event Logs with 4741 EventCode enabled. The Windows TA is also
  required.
known_false_positives: It is possible third party applications may add these SPNs
  to Computer Accounts, filtering may be needed.
