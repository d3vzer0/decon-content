description: The following analytic identifies the decompile parameter with the HTML
  Help application, HH.exe. This is a uncommon command to see ran and behavior. Most
  recently this was seen in a APT41 campaign where a CHM file was delivered and a
  script inside used a technique for running an arbitrary command in a CHM file via
  an ActiveX object. This unpacks an HTML help file to a specified path for launching
  the next stage.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where `process_hh` Processes.process=*-decompile*
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_system_binary_proxy_execution_compiled_html_file_decompile_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
