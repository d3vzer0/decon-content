description: This analytic indentifies WMIC command-line attempting to uninstall application
  non-interactively. This technique was seen in IcedID to uninstall AV products on
  the compromised host to evade detection. This Hunting query maybe a good indicator
  that some process tries to uninstall application using wmic which is not a common
  behavior. This approach may seen in some script or third part appication to uninstall
  their application but it is a good thing to check what it uninstall and why.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=wmic.exe
  Processes.process="* product *" Processes.process="*where name*" Processes.process="*call
  uninstall*" Processes.process="*/nointeractive*" by Processes.dest Processes.user
  Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `wmic_noninteractive_app_uninstallation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Third party application may use this approach to uninstall
  applications.
