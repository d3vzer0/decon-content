status: experimental
type: TTP
description: This search detects the heap-based buffer overflow of sudoedit
data_source: []
search: '`linux_hosts` TERM(sudoedit) TERM(segfault) | stats count min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime by host | where count > 5 | `detect_baron_samedit_cve_2021_3156_segfault_filter`'
how_to_implement: Splunk Universal Forwarder running on Linux systems (tested on Centos
  and Ubuntu), where segfaults are being logged.  This also captures instances where
  the exploit has been compiled into a binary. The detection looks for greater than
  5 instances of sudoedit combined with segfault over your search time period on a
  single host
known_false_positives: If sudoedit is throwing segfaults for other reasons this will
  pick those up too.
