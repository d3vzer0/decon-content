description: This analytic identifies an endpoint that remotely connects to another endpoint to create a new service using sc.exe. On the remote endpoint, the new service will be created and this action will trigger the creation of EventCode 7045 along with all the resulting service information.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=sc.exe Processes.process IN ("*create*")  Processes.process="*\\\\*"
   by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.original_file_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` 
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_remote_create_service_filter`'
how_to_implement: To implement this search, it is necessary to ingest information on processes that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from your endpoints into the Endpoint data model within the Processes node. Additionally, it is recommended to confirm that the latest version of CIM App (4.20 or higher) and the latest TA for the endpoint product are installed.
known_false_positives: Note that false positives may occur, and filtering may be necessary, especially when it comes to remote service creation by administrators or software management utilities.
