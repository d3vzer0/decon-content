name: Splunk Data exfiltration from Analytics Workspace using sid query
id: b6d77c6c-f011-4b03-8650-8f10edb7c4a8
version: 2
date: '2024-05-25'
author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis
status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exfiltrate data by executing
  a prepositioned malicious search ID in Splunk's Analytic Workspace. It leverages
  the `audit_searches` data source to detect suspicious `mstats` commands indicative
  of injection attempts. This activity is significant as it may indicate a phishing-based
  attack where an attacker compels a victim to initiate a malicious request, potentially
  leading to unauthorized data access. If confirmed malicious, this could result in
  significant data exfiltration, compromising sensitive information and impacting
  the organization's security posture.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`audit_searches` info=granted search NOT ("audit_searches") search NOT ("security_content_summariesonly")
  AND ((search="*mstats*[*]*" AND provenance="N/A") OR (search="*mstats*\\\"*[*]*\\\"*"))|
  eval warning=if(match(search,"\\\\\""), "POTENTIAL INJECTION STAGING", "POTENTIAL
  INJECTION EXECUTION") | table search, user, warning, timestamp | `splunk_data_exfiltration_from_analytics_workspace_using_sid_query_filter`'
how_to_implement: The vulnerability affects only instances with Splunk Web Enabled.  After
  running this search, please run "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky
  SPL MLTK" to gain more insight into potentially risky commands which could lead
  to data exfiltration.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives.  This detection does
  not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require the ability to
  search the _audit index. Special attention must be paid to "/en-US/app/search/analytics_workspace?sid=[sid]"
  which is where the malicious code will be inserted to trigger attack at victim.
