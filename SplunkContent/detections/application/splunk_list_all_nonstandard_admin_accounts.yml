description: 'The following analytic identifies nonstandard Splunk accounts with administrative
  rights on the instance, excluding the default admin account. It uses REST API calls
  to retrieve user data and filters for accounts with admin capabilities. This activity
  is significant as unauthorized admin accounts can indicate potential security breaches
  or misconfigurations. If confirmed malicious, attackers could leverage these accounts
  to execute commands, escalate privileges, or persist within the environment, posing
  a significant risk to the integrity and security of the Splunk instance.'
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '| rest splunk_server=local /services/authentication/users |search capabilities=admin*
  OR imported_capabilities=admin* title!=admin | table title roles capabilities splunk_server
  | `splunk_list_all_nonstandard_admin_accounts_filter`'
how_to_implement: The user running this search is required to have a permission allowing
  them to dispatch REST requests to indexers (the `dispatch_rest_to_indexers` capability)
  in some architectures.  If there have been admin account, in addition to the standard
  admin account, intentionally created on this server, then edit the filter macro
  to exclude them.
known_false_positives: It is not possible to discern from the user table whether or
  not users with admin rights have been created intentionally, accidentally, or as
  a result of exploitation. Each user with these rights should be investigated and,
  if legitimate, added to the filter macro above.  If a user is not believed to be
  legitimate, then further investigation should take place.
