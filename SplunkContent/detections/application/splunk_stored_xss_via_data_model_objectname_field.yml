description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a stored cross-site
  scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise via the Data Model object name
  field. It detects this activity by analyzing web access logs (`splunkd_webx`) for
  specific URI patterns and non-null query parameters. This activity is significant
  because it allows authenticated users to inject and store malicious scripts, leading
  to persistent XSS attacks. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to
  execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users, potentially leading to
  data theft, session hijacking, or further compromise of the Splunk environment.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd_webx` uri=/*/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/launcher/datamodel/model*
  uri_query!=null | stats count by _time host status clientip user uri | `splunk_stored_xss_via_data_model_objectname_field_filter`'
how_to_implement: This vulnerability only affects Splunk Web enabled instances. This
  detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require
  the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives and does not cover
  exploitation attempts via code obfuscation, focus of search is suspicious requests
  against "/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/*/launcher/datamodel/model" which is the
  injection point.
