description: The following analytic detects attempts to bypass URL validation in Splunk
  Enterprise versions below 9.0.4, 8.2.10, and 8.1.13 by targeting the vulnerable
  bootstrap version 2.3.1. It leverages `splunkd_web` logs, specifically monitoring
  GET requests to JavaScript files within the vulnerable bootstrap path. This activity
  is significant as it can allow a low-privileged user to perform path traversal,
  potentially accessing restricted and confidential information. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to unauthorized data access and compromise of sensitive information,
  including targeting admin users.
search: '`splunkd_web` method=GET uri_path="*bootstrap-2.3.1*" file="*.js" | table
  _time clientip uri_path file status | `splunk_persistent_xss_via_url_validation_bypass_w_dashboard_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search does not require additional data to be ingested. This
  search requires ability to search _internal index. This search helps discover access
  to vulnerable bootstrap versions.
known_false_positives: This search will produce numerous false positives as it shows
  ANY accesses to vulnerable bootstrap Javascript files.  Accesses to these files
  occur during normal Splunk usage. To reduce or eliminate false positives, update
  the a version of Splunk which has addressed the vulnerability.
