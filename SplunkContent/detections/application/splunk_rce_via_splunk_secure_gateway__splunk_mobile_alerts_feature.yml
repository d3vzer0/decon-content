description: The following analytic identifies potential exploitation attempts against
  the Splunk Secure Gateway App's Mobile Alerts feature in Splunk versions 9.0, 8.2.x,
  and 8.1.x. It detects suspicious activity by monitoring requests to the mobile alerts
  endpoint using specific URI paths and query parameters. This activity is significant
  because an authenticated user could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary
  operating system commands remotely. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized
  code execution, compromising the integrity and security of the Splunk environment.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkda` uri_path="/servicesNS/nobody/splunk_secure_gateway/storage/collections/data/mobile_alerts*"
  sort="notification.created_at:-1" | table  clientip file host method uri_query sort
  | `splunk_rce_via_splunk_secure_gateway__splunk_mobile_alerts_feature_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search only applies if Splunk Mobile Gateway is deployed in
  the vulnerable Splunk versions.
known_false_positives: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data.
  The detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. Focus of this
  search is 
  "uri_path=/servicesNS/nobody/splunk_secure_gateway/storage/collections/data/mobile_alerts*"
  which is the injection point.
