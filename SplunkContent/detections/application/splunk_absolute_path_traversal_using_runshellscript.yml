name: Splunk Absolute Path Traversal Using runshellscript

description: The following analytic detects the exploitation of an absolute path traversal
  vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise versions lower than 8.2.12, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1,
  where an attacker can execute arbitrary code located on a separate disk. It leverages
  logs from the `splunk_python` macro, specifically looking for the `runshellscript`
  command with a specific argument count and path pattern. This activity is significant
  as it indicates a potential exploitation attempt that could lead to unauthorized
  code execution. If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to gain control
  over the Splunk instance, leading to data breaches or further system compromise.
search: >-
  `splunk_python` *runshellscript*  | eval log_split=split(_raw, "runshellscript:
  ")
  | eval array_raw = mvindex(log_split,1)
  | eval data_cleaned=replace(replace(replace(array_raw,"\[",""),"\]",""),"'","")
  | eval array_indices=split(data_cleaned,",")
  | eval runshellscript_args_count=mvcount(array_indices)
  | where runshellscript_args_count = 10
  | eval interpreter=mvindex(array_indices,0)
  | eval targetScript=mvindex(array_indices,1)
  | eval targetScript != "*C:*"
  | stats count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by splunk_server interpreter
  targetScript
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `splunk_absolute_path_traversal_using_runshellscript_filter`
how_to_implement: Must have access to internal indexes. Only applies to Splunk on
  Windows versions.
known_false_positives: The command runshellscript can be used for benign purposes.
  Analyst will have to review the searches and determined maliciousness specially
  by looking at targeted script.
