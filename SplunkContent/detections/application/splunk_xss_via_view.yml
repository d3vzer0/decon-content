name: Splunk XSS via View
id: 9ac2bfea-a234-4a18-9d37-6d747e85c2e4

author: Rod Soto, Eric McGinnis, Splunk
status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic identifies potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  attempts via the 'layoutPanel' attribute in the 'module' tag within XML Views in
  Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4. It leverages internal
  logs from "splunk_web_service" and "splunk_python" sourcetypes, focusing on messages
  containing "loadParams." This activity is significant as it can lead to unauthorized
  script execution within the Splunk Web interface, potentially compromising the security
  of the instance. If confirmed malicious, attackers could execute arbitrary scripts,
  leading to data theft, session hijacking, or further exploitation of the Splunk
  environment.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: 'index = _internal sourcetype IN ("splunk_web_service", "splunk_python") message="*loadParams*"
  | `security_content_ctime(_time)` |  table _time message fileName | `splunk_xss_via_view_filter`'
how_to_implement: This data is collected by default in Splunk.  Upon first enabling
  this rule, a number of errors may be observed. Those that are due to improperly
  formatted, but non-nefarious, XML views should be be remedied in the corresponding
  view. Please take care investigating potential XSS as accessing an affected page
  could retrigger the exploit.
known_false_positives: The error detected above can be generated for a wide variety
  of improperly formatted XML views.  There will be false positives as the search
  cannot extract the malicious payload and the view should be manually investigated.
