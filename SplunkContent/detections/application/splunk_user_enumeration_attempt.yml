name: Splunk User Enumeration Attempt
id: 25625cb4-1c4d-4463-b0f9-7cb462699cde

status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to enumerate usernames in
  Splunk by detecting multiple failed authentication attempts from the same source.
  It leverages data from the `_audit` index, specifically focusing on failed authentication
  events. This activity is significant for a SOC because it can indicate an attacker
  trying to discover valid usernames, which is a precursor to more targeted attacks
  like password spraying or brute force attempts. If confirmed malicious, this activity
  could lead to unauthorized access, compromising the security of the Splunk environment
  and potentially exposing sensitive data.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: ' `splunkd_failed_auths` | stats count(user) as auths by user, src | where
  auths>5 | stats values(user) as user, sum(auths) as TotalFailedAuths by src | `splunk_user_enumeration_attempt_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This detection may
  assist in efforts to find password spraying or brute force authorization attempts
  in addition to someone enumerating usernames.
known_false_positives: Automation executing authentication attempts against your Splunk
  infrastructure with outdated credentials may cause false positives.
