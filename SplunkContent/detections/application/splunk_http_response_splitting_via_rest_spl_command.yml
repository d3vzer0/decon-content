description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit an HTTP response
  splitting vulnerability via the rest SPL command in Splunk. It detects this activity
  by analyzing audit logs for specific search commands that include REST methods like
  POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE. This behavior is significant because it indicates a
  potential attempt to access restricted REST endpoints, which could lead to unauthorized
  access to sensitive information. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  an attacker to access restricted content, such as password files, by injecting commands
  into HTTP requests.
search: '`audit_searches` AND search IN ("*|*rest*POST*","*|*rest*PUT*","*|*rest*PATCH*","*|*rest*DELETE*")
  AND NOT search="*audit_searches*" | table user info has_error_msg search _time  |
  `splunk_http_response_splitting_via_rest_spl_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _audit index. This search may assist
  in detecting possible http response splitting exploitation attemptss.
known_false_positives: This search may have produce false positives as malformed or
  erroneous requests made to this endpoint may be executed willingly or erroneously
  by operators.
