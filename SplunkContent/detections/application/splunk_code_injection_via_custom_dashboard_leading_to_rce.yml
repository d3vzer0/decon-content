description: This hunting search provides information about a vulnerability in Splunk
  Enterprise versions below 8.2.9, 8.1.12, 9.0.2, where an authenticated user can
  execute arbitrary code via the dashboard pdf generation component. Please review

how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: Not all exports and downloads are malicious, special attention
  must be put as well on /en-US/splunkd/__raw/services/pdfgen/render in the context
  of this search.
