name: Splunk App for Lookup File Editing RCE via User XSLT
id: a053e6a6-2146-483a-9798-2d43652f3299
version: 2
date: '2024-05-16'
author: Rod Soto, Splunk
status: experimental
type: Hunting
data_source: []
description: The following analytic identifies the creation of lookup files in Splunk,
  which could indicate an attempt to exploit remote code execution via user-supplied
  XSLT. It leverages REST API queries to monitor the creation of these lookups, focusing
  on fields such as title, author, and access control lists. This activity is significant
  because it targets a known vulnerability in Splunk versions 9.1.x, potentially allowing
  attackers to execute arbitrary code. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized code execution, compromising the integrity and security of the Splunk
  environment.

how_to_implement: Because there is no way to detect the payload, this search only
  provides the ability to monitor the creation of lookups which are the base of this
  exploit. An operator must then investigate suspicious lookups. This search requires
  ability to perform REST queries. Note that if the Splunk App for Lookup File Editing
  is not, or was not, installed in the Splunk environment then it is not necessary
  to run the search as the enviornment was not vulnerable.
known_false_positives: This search will provide information for investigation and
  hunting of lookup creation via user-supplied XSLT which may be indications of possible
  exploitation. There will be false positives as it is not possible to detect the
  payload executed via this exploit.
