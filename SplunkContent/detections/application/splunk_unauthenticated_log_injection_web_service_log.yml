author: Rod Soto
status: production
type: Hunting
data_source:
- Splunk
description: The following analytic identifies potential log injection attempts into
  the Splunk server via specially crafted web URLs. It detects ANSI escape codes within
  the `uri_path` field of `splunkd_webx` logs. This activity is significant as it
  can lead to log file manipulation, potentially obfuscating malicious actions or
  misleading analysts. If confirmed malicious, an attacker could manipulate log files
  to hide their tracks or execute further attacks, compromising the integrity of the
  logging system and making incident response more challenging.
search: '`splunkd_webx`  uri_path IN ("*\x1B*", "*\u001b*", "*\033*", "*\0x9*", "*\0x8*")
  | stats count by uri_path method host status clientip | `splunk_unauthenticated_log_injection_web_service_log_filter`'
how_to_implement: This only affects web enabled Splunk instances. The detection does
  require the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: This hunting search will produce false positives if ANSI escape
  characters are included in URLs either voluntarily or by accident. This search will
  not detect obfuscated ANSI characters.
