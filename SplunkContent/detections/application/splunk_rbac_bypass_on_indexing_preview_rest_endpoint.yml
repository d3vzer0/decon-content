- Splunk
description: The following analytic identifies unauthorized attempts to use the /services/indexing/preview
  REST endpoint in Splunk. It detects POST requests to this endpoint by monitoring
  the _internal index for specific URI patterns. This activity is significant because
  it indicates a potential RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) bypass, allowing unauthorized
  users to overwrite search results if they know the search ID (SID) of an existing
  job. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to data manipulation, unauthorized
  access to sensitive information, and compromised integrity of search results.
search: '`splunkda` method="POST" uri="*/services/indexing/preview*" | table host
  clientip status useragent user uri_path | `splunk_rbac_bypass_on_indexing_preview_rest_endpoint_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search does not require additional data ingestion. It requires
  the ability to search _internal index.
known_false_positives: This is a hunting search which provides verbose results against
  this endpoint. Operator must consider things such as IP address, useragent and user(specially
  low privelege) and host to investigate possible attack.
