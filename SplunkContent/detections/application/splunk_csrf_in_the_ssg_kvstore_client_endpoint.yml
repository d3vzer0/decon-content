description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a cross-site request
  forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Splunk Secure Gateway (SSG) app's kvstore_client
  endpoint. It detects GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint using internal index
  data, focusing on specific URI paths and HTTP methods. This activity is significant
  because it can allow unauthorized updates to SSG KV store collections, potentially
  leading to data manipulation or unauthorized access. If confirmed malicious, this
  could enable attackers to alter critical configurations or exfiltrate sensitive
  information, compromising the integrity and security of the Splunk environment.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkda` uri_path="/*/splunkd/__raw/services/ssg/kvstore_client" method="GET"
  delete_field_value="spacebridge_server" status="200"  | table splunk_server status
  uri delete_field_value method post_data  | `splunk_csrf_in_the_ssg_kvstore_client_endpoint_filter`'
how_to_implement: Requires access to internal index.
known_false_positives: This hunting search only applies to the affected versions and
  setup mentioned in the description of this search, it does not extract payload so
  it requires manual investigation after executing search. This search will produce
  false positives.
