description: The following analytic identifies path traversal attempts in the Splunk
  App for Lookup File Editing. It detects specially crafted web requests targeting
  lookup files by analyzing the `uri_query` field in the `_internal` index. This activity
  is significant because it allows low-privilege users to read and write to restricted
  areas of the Splunk installation directory, potentially accessing sensitive files
  like password hashes. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to unauthorized access,
  data breaches, and further exploitation of the Splunk environment.
search: '`splunkda` uri_query=*lookup_file* | table clientip uri_query lookup_file
  owner namespace  version | stats count by clientip namespace lookup_file uri_query
  | `splunk_path_traversal_in_splunk_app_for_lookup_file_edit_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This detection
  is meant for on premise environments, and if executed on internet facing servers
  without a WAF may produce a lot of results. This detection will not work against
  obfuscated path traversal requests.
known_false_positives: This search may find additional path traversal exploitation
  attempts or malformed requests.
