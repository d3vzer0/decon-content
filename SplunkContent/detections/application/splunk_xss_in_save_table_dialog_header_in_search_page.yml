description: The following analytic identifies persistent cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attempts in the 'Save Table' dialog on the Splunk search page. It detects POST requests
  to the endpoint `/en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model`
  containing potential XSS payloads. This activity is significant because it can allow
  a remote user with the "power" role to inject malicious scripts, leading to persistent
  XSS vulnerabilities. If confirmed malicious, this could enable attackers to execute
  arbitrary scripts in the context of the affected user, potentially leading to data
  theft, session hijacking, or further exploitation within the Splunk environment.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd_webx` method=POST  uri=/*/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model
  | table _time host status clientip user uri | `splunk_xss_in_save_table_dialog_header_in_search_page_filter`'
how_to_implement: Watch for POST requests combined with XSS script strings or obfuscation
  against the injection point /en-US/splunkd/__raw/servicesNS/nobody/search/datamodel/model.
known_false_positives: If host is vulnerable and XSS script strings are inputted they
  will show up in search. Not all Post requests are malicious as they will show when
  users create and save dashboards. This search may produce several results with non
  malicious POST requests. Only affects Splunk Web enabled instances.
