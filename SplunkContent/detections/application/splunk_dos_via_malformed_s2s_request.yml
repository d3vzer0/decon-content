name: Splunk DoS via Malformed S2S Request
id: fc246e56-953b-40c1-8634-868f9e474cbd
version: 3
date: '2024-05-27'
author: Lou Stella, Splunk
status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a Denial of Service
  (DoS) vulnerability in the Splunk-to-Splunk (S2S) protocol by detecting malformed
  S2S requests. It leverages `splunkd` logs, specifically looking for "ERROR" level
  logs from the "TcpInputProc" component with the thread name "FwdDataReceiverThread"
  and the message "Invalid _meta atom." This activity is significant as it targets
  a known vulnerability that could disrupt Splunk services. If confirmed malicious,
  this could lead to service outages, impacting the availability and reliability of
  Splunk for monitoring and analysis.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd` log_level="ERROR" component="TcpInputProc" thread_name="FwdDataReceiverThread"
  "Invalid _meta atom" | table host, src | `splunk_dos_via_malformed_s2s_request_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This detection
  will only find attempted exploitation on versions of Splunk already patched for
  CVE-2021-3422.
known_false_positives: None.
