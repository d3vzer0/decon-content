status: production
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies crashes in the Splunk search app caused
  by specially crafted ZIP files, affecting Universal Forwarder versions 8.1.11 and
  8.2 versions below 8.2.7.1. It detects this activity by monitoring Universal Forwarder
  error logs for specific messages indicating invalid or binary file issues. This
  activity is significant because it can disrupt Splunk operations, leading to potential
  data loss or monitoring gaps. If confirmed malicious, this attack could result in
  a denial of service, hindering the organization's ability to monitor and respond
  to other security incidents effectively.

- Splunk
search: '`splunkd` component=FileClassifierManager event_message=*invalid* event_message=*binary*
  |stats count by host component event_message | `splunk_endpoint_denial_of_service_dos_zip_bomb_filter`'
how_to_implement: Need to monitor Splunkd data from Universal Forwarders.
known_false_positives: This search may reveal non malicious zip files causing errors
  as well.
