name: Splunk Reflected XSS in the templates lists radio

status: production
type: Hunting
description: The following analytic identifies potential reflected cross-site scripting
  (XSS) attempts in Splunk versions below 8.1.12, 8.2.9, and 9.0.2. It detects when
  a query parameter with `output_mode=radio` is used in a URI, leveraging `splunkd_webx`
  logs with status 200 and non-null URI queries. This activity is significant as it
  can indicate an attempt to exploit a known vulnerability, potentially allowing attackers
  to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser. If confirmed
  malicious, this could lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise
  of the affected Splunk instance.
data_source:
- Splunk
search: '`splunkd_webx` user=admin status=200 uri=*/lists/entities/x/ui/views* uri_query!=null
  | stats count earliest(_time) as event_time values(status) as status values(clientip)
  as clientip by index, sourcetype, _time, host, user, uri | `splunk_reflected_xss_in_the_templates_lists_radio_filter`'
how_to_implement: This vulnerability only affects instances with Splunk Web enabled.
  This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The detection does require
  the ability to search the _internal index.
known_false_positives: This search may produce false positives as it is difficult
  to pinpoint all possible XSS injection characters in a single search string. Special
  attention is required to "en-US/list/entities/x/ui/views" which is the vulnerable
  injection point.
