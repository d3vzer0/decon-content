name: Okta ThreatInsight Threat Detected
id: 140504ae-5fe2-4d65-b2bc-a211813fbca6

date: '2022-09-21'
author: Michael Haag, Splunk
status: experimental
type: Anomaly
description: The following anomaly relies on the Okta ThreatInsight identification
  of a threat. Use this to drive risk up by src_ip or add additional fields to track.
  Identification may include password spraying, login failures and Login failures
  with high unknown users count.
data_source: []
search: '`okta` eventType IN (security.threat.detected, security.internal.threat.detected)
  | rename client.geographicalContext.country as country, client.geographicalContext.state
  as state, client.geographicalContext.city as city | stats values(src_ip) count by
  signature eventType displayMessage client.device city state country user_agent outcome.reason
  outcome.result severity | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `okta_threatinsight_threat_detected_filter`'
how_to_implement: This analytic is specific to Okta and requires Okta logs to be ingested.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune Okta and tune the analytic
  to ensure proper fidelity. Modify risk score as needed.
