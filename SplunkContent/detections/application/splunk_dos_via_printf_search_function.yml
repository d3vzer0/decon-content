name: Splunk DOS via printf search function

data_source:
- Splunk
description: The following analytic identifies the use of the `printf` SPL function
  in Splunk searches, which can be exploited for a denial of service (DoS) attack.
  It detects this activity by querying the `audit_searches` data source for specific
  patterns involving `makeresults`, `eval`, `fieldformat`, and `printf` functions,
  excluding searches by the `splunk_system_user`. This activity is significant because
  it targets a known vulnerability in Splunk Enterprise versions lower than 8.1.14,
  8.2.12, 9.0.6, and 9.1.1, potentially disrupting the availability of the Splunk
  instance. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to service outages and impact
  the monitoring and logging capabilities of the organization.
search: '`audit_searches` "*makeresults * eval * fieldformat *printf*" user!="splunk_system_user"
  search!="*audit_searches*" | stats count by user splunk_server host search | convert
  ctime(*time) |`splunk_dos_via_printf_search_function_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search requires the ability to search internal indexes.
known_false_positives: This search may produces false positives, analyst most focuse
  in the use of printf conversion function of eval to craft an expression that splunkd
  cannot interpret correctly causing it to crash.
