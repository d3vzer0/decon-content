description: The following analytic identifies user activity related to uploading
  lookup tables with unnecessary filename extensions in Splunk Enterprise versions
  below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4. It detects this activity by monitoring HTTP methods
  (POST, DELETE) and specific URI paths in the internal `splunkd_access` logs. This
  behavior is significant because it can indicate attempts to upload potentially malicious
  files disguised as lookup tables. If confirmed malicious, this activity could allow
  an attacker to execute unauthorized code or manipulate data within the Splunk environment,
  leading to potential data breaches or system compromise.
search: '`splunkda` method IN ("POST", "DELETE") uri_path=/servicesNS/*/ui/views/*
  | eval activity = case( method=="POST" AND like( uri_path , "%/acl" ) , "Permissions
  Update", method=="POST" AND NOT like( uri_path , "%/acl" ) , "Edited" , method=="DELETE"
  , "Deleted" ) | rex field=uri_path "(?<user_and_app>.*?)\/ui\/views/(?<dashboard_encoded>.*)"
  | eval dashboard = urldecode( dashboard_encoded ) | table _time, uri_path, user,
  dashboard, activity, uri_path | `splunk_unnecessary_file_extensions_allowed_by_lookup_table_uploads_filter`'
how_to_implement: Requires access to internal splunkd_access.
known_false_positives: This is a hunting search, the search provides information on
  upload, edit, and delete activity on Lookup Tables. Manual investigation is necessary
  after executing search. This search will produce false positives as payload cannot
  be directly discerned.
