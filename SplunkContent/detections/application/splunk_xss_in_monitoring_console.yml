name: Splunk XSS in Monitoring Console
id: b11accac-6fa3-4103-8a1a-7210f1a67087
version: 2
date: '2024-05-17'
author: Lou Stella, Splunk
status: experimental
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies attempts to exploit a reflective Cross-Site
  Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Splunk Distributed Monitoring Console app.
  It detects GET requests with suspicious query parameters by analyzing `splunkd_web`
  logs in the _internal index. This activity is significant because it targets a known
  vulnerability (CVE-2022-27183) that could allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts
  in the context of the user's browser. If confirmed malicious, this could lead to
  unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise of the Splunk environment.
data_source: []
search: ' `splunkd_web` method="GET" uri_query="description=%3C*" | table _time host
  status clientip user uri | `splunk_xss_in_monitoring_console_filter`'
how_to_implement: This detection does not require you to ingest any new data. The
  detection does require the ability to search the _internal index. This detection
  will find attempted exploitation of CVE-2022-27183.
known_false_positives: Use of the monitoring console where the less-than sign (<)
  is the first character in the description field.
