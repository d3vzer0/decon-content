data_source:
- Splunk
description: The following analytic identifies a potential Denial of Service (DoS)
  attack exploiting the dump SPL command in vulnerable Splunk Enterprise versions.
  It detects this activity by searching the `splunk_crash_log` for segmentation fault
  entries, indicating a crash of the Splunk daemon. This activity is significant for
  a SOC because it can disrupt the availability of Splunk services, impacting monitoring
  and incident response capabilities. If confirmed malicious, this attack could render
  Splunk Enterprise unusable, severely hindering an organization's ability to detect
  and respond to other security threats.
search: '`splunk_crash_log` "*Segmentation fault*" | stats count by host _time | `splunk_dos_via_dump_spl_command_filter`'
how_to_implement: This search does not require additional ingestion of data. Requires
  the ability to search _internal index and monitor segmentation faults.
known_false_positives: Segmentation faults may occur due to other causes, so this
  search may produce false positives
