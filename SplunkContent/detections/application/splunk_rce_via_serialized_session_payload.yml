description: The following analytic detects the execution of a specially crafted query
  using the 'collect' SPL command in Splunk Enterprise versions lower than 8.2.12,
  9.0.6, and 9.1.1. It leverages audit logs to identify searches containing both 'makeresults'
  and 'collect' commands. This activity is significant because it can indicate an
  attempt to serialize untrusted data, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
  If confirmed malicious, this could allow an attacker to execute code within the
  Splunk environment, leading to unauthorized access and control over the system.

how_to_implement: Requires access to the _audit index.
known_false_positives: There are numerous many uses of the 'makeresults' and 'collect'
  SPL commands. Please evaluate the results of this search for potential abuse.
