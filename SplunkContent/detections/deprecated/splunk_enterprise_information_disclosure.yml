how_to_implement: The REST endpoint that exposes system information is also necessary
  for the proper operation of Splunk clustering and instrumentation. Whitelisting
  your Splunk systems will reduce false positives.
known_false_positives: Retrieving server information may be a legitimate API request.
  Verify that the attempt is a valid request for information.
