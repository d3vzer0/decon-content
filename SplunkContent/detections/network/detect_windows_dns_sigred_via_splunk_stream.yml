description: The following analytic is an experimental search designed to identify SIGRed exploitation attempts. SIGRed is a severe, wormable, remote code execution vulnerability in Windows DNS servers, identified as CVE-2020-1350. This analytic specifically looks for DNS SIG and KEY records, and TCP payloads larger than 65KB - potential indicators of the SIGRed exploit. It requires ingestion of both Splunk Stream DNS and TCP data. The search does rely on macro definitions for 'stream:dns' and 'stream:tcp', which should be replaced with appropriate configurations tailored to your Splunk environment. 
data_source: []
search: '`stream_dns` | spath "query_type{}" | search "query_type{}" IN (SIG,KEY)
  | spath protocol_stack | search protocol_stack="ip:tcp:dns" | append [search `stream_tcp`
  bytes_out>65000] | `detect_windows_dns_sigred_via_splunk_stream_filter` | stats
  count by flow_id | where count>1 | fields - count'
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting Splunk Stream DNS and Splunk Stream TCP. We
  are detecting SIG and KEY records via stream:dns and TCP payload over 65KB in size
  via stream:tcp.  Replace the macro definitions ('stream:dns' and 'stream:tcp') with
  configurations for your Splunk environment.
