description: The following analytic identifies an Azure AD account successfully authenticating
  from more than one unique Ip address in the span of 5 minutes. This behavior could
  represent an adversary who has stolen credentials via a phishing attack or some
  other method and using them to access corporate online resources around the same
  time as a legitimate user. As users may behave differently across organizations,
  security teams should test and customize this detection to fit their environments.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment through an EventHub.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the SignInLogs log category.
known_false_positives: A user with successful authentication events from different
  Ips may also represent the legitimate use of more than one device. Filter as needed
  and/or customize the threshold to fit your environment.
