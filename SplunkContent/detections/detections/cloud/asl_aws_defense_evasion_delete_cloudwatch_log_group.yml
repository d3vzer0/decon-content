description: This analytic identifies AWS `DeleteLogGroup` events in CloudTrail logs.
  Attackers may evade the logging capability by deleting the log group in CloudWatch.
  This will stop sending the logs and metrics to CloudWatch. When the adversary has
  the right type of permissions within the compromised AWS environment, they may delete
  the CloudWatch log group that is logging activities in the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format. 
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has deleted CloudWatch logging. Please investigate this activity.
