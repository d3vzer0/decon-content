description: The following analytic seeks to detect the creation of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) permanent event subscriptions, a technique often used by adversaries for persistence. Such a subscription allows for the execution of specified scripts or binaries in response to defined system events, potentially enabling malicious activities to persist unnoticed. The analytic uses Sysmon Event ID 5 data, specifically focusing on instances where consumers of these events are not the expected "NTEventLogEventConsumer." Although WMI event subscriptions can be used legitimately by administrators, unusual or unexpected subscription creation should be treated as suspicious. Analysts need to be cognizant of the potential for false positives in legitimate administrative activities and should understand WMI activity within the context of the monitored environment.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 5
search: '`wmi` EventCode=5861 Binding | rex field=Message "Consumer =\s+(?<consumer>[^;|^$]+)"
  | search consumer!="NTEventLogEventConsumer=\"SCM Event Log Consumer\"" | stats
  count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime by ComputerName, consumer,
  Message | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`| `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | rename ComputerName as dest | `wmi_permanent_event_subscription_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting the
  Windows WMI activity logs. This can be done by adding a stanza to inputs.conf on
  the system generating logs with a title of [WinEventLog://Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity/Operational].
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use event subscriptions
  for legitimate purposes.
