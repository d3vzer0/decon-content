description: The following analytic identifies the use of CreateDump.exe being used
  to perform a process dump. This particular binary is not native to Windows, but
  is found to be brought in my many different third party applications including PowerShell
  7.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=createdump.exe
  OR Processes.original_file_name="FX_VER_INTERNALNAME_STR" Processes.process="*-u
  *" AND Processes.process="*-f *" by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name
  Processes.process_name Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id
  | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  | `windows_credential_dumping_lsass_memory_createdump_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if an application is dumping
  processes, filter as needed. Recommend reviewing createdump.exe usage across the
  fleet to better understand all usage and by what.
