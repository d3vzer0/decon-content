description: This search looks for processes launching netsh.exe. Netsh is a command-line
  scripting utility that allows you to, either locally or remotely, display or modify
  the network configuration of a computer that is currently running. Netsh can be
  used as a persistence proxy technique to execute a helper DLL when netsh.exe is
  executed. In this search, we are looking for processes spawned by netsh.exe and
  executing commands via the command line.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count values(Processes.process)
  AS Processes.process min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes
  where `process_netsh` by Processes.parent_process_name Processes.parent_process
  Processes.original_file_name Processes.process_name Processes.user Processes.dest
  |`drop_dm_object_name("Processes")` |`security_content_ctime(firstTime)` |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)`
  |`processes_launching_netsh_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Some VPN applications are known to launch netsh.exe. Outside
  of these instances, it is unusual for an executable to launch netsh.exe and run
  commands.
