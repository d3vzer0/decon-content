description: EMACS is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility.
  The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as "the extensible,
  customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". If sudo right is given
  to EMACS tool for the user, then the user can run special commands as root and possibly
  get a root shell.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process="*emacs*"
  AND Processes.process="*--eval*" AND Processes.process="*sudo*" by Processes.dest
  Processes.user Processes.parent_process_name Processes.process_name Processes.process
  Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id Processes.process_guid | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `linux_emacs_privilege_escalation_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints into the Endpoint datamodel. If you are using Sysmon, you can use the
  Add-on for Linux Sysmon from Splunkbase.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed.
