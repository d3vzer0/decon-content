description: The following analytic is designed to detect the potential misuse of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) for malicious purposes. WMI can be utilized by adversaries to execute scripts, a method often employed for maintaining stealth while carrying out malicious activities. The process 'scrcons.exe', integral to executing WMI scripts, is primarily monitored by this analytic. The underlying threat lies in the fact that successful execution of a malicious script can lead to numerous negative outcomes, including system compromise, data exfiltration, or the establishment of persistence. It's essential for cybersecurity analysts to remain vigilant towards unexpected or isolated script executions via WMI, as such instances often signal suspicious activities or potential security breaches. Although uncommon, administrators may occasionally use WMI to launch scripts for legitimate purposes. Therefore, discerning malicious activities from benign ones is crucial in this context.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_name=scrcons.exe
  by Processes.dest Processes.user Processes.parent_process Processes.process_name
  Processes.process Processes.process_id Processes.parent_process_id | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)`
  | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)` | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `script_execution_via_wmi_filter` '
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, administrators may use wmi to launch scripts
  for legitimate purposes. Filter as needed.
