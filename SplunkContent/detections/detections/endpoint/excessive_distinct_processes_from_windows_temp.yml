description: This analytic will identify suspicious series of process executions.  We
  have observed that post exploit framework tools like Koadic and Meterpreter will
  launch an excessive number of processes with distinct file paths from Windows\Temp
  to execute actions on objective.  This behavior is extremely anomalous compared
  to typical application behaviors that use Windows\Temp.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` values(Processes.process) as process
  distinct_count(Processes.process) as distinct_process_count  min(_time) as firstTime
  max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.process_path
  = "*\\Windows\\Temp\\*" by Processes.dest Processes.user  _time span=20m | where
  distinct_process_count > 37 | `drop_dm_object_name(Processes)` | `security_content_ctime(firstTime)`
  | `security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `excessive_distinct_processes_from_windows_temp_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the full process path in the process field of CIM's Process data model.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Tune and filter known instances where renamed sc.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Many benign applications will create processes from executables
  in Windows\Temp, although unlikely to exceed the given threshold.  Filter as needed.
