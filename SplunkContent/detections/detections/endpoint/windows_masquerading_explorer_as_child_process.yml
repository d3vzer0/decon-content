description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious parent process of explorer.exe.
  Explorer is usually executed by userinit.exe that will exit after execution that
  causes the main explorer.exe no parent process. Some malware like qakbot spawn another
  explorer.exe to inject its code. This TTP detection is a good indicator that a process
  spawning explorer.exe might inject code or masquerading its parent child process
  to evade detections.

search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes where Processes.parent_process_name
  IN("cmd.exe", "powershell.exe", "regsvr32.exe") AND Processes.process_name = "explorer.exe"

  |`security_content_ctime(lastTime)` | `windows_masquerading_explorer_as_child_process_filter`'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
