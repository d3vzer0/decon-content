description: 'The search looks for the Console Window Host process (connhost.exe)
  executed using the force flag -ForceV1. This is not regular behavior in the Windows
  OS and is often seen executed by the Ryuk Ransomware. DEPRECATED This event is actually
  seen in the windows 10 client of attack_range_local. After further testing we realized
  this is not specific to Ryuk. '
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time)
  as lastTime FROM datamodel=Endpoint.Processes WHERE Processes.process="*C:\\Windows\\system32\\conhost.exe*
  0xffffffff *-ForceV1*" by Processes.user Processes.process_name Processes.process

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records the process-system activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint Processes data-model object. If you are
  using Sysmon, you will need a Splunk Universal Forwarder on each endpoint from which
  you want to collect data.
known_false_positives: This process should not be ran forcefully, we have not see
  any false positives for this detection
