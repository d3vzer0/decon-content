description: The following detection identifes when a policy is deleted on AWS. This
  does not identify whether successful or failed, but the error messages tell a story
  of suspicious attempts. There is a specific process to follow when deleting a policy.
  First, detach the policy from all users, groups, and roles that the policy is attached
  to, using DetachUserPolicy , DetachGroupPolicy , or DetachRolePolicy.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format. 
known_false_positives: This detection will require tuning to provide high fidelity
  detection capabilties. Tune based on src addresses (corporate offices, VPN terminations)
  or by groups of users. Not every user with AWS access should have permission to
  delete policies (least privilege). In addition, this may be saved seperately and
  tuned for failed or success attempts only.
