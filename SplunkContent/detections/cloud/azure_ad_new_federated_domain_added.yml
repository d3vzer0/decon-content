description: The following analytic identifies the addition of a new federated domain
  within an Azure Active Directory tenant. This event could represent the execution
  of the Azure Active Directory identity federation backdoor technique discovered
  by security researcher Nestori Syynimaa. Similar to Active Directory, Azure AD uses
  the concept of domains to manage directories of identities. A new Azure AD tenant
  will initially contain a single domain that is commonly called the `cloud-only`
  onmicrosoft.com domain. Organizations can also add their registered custom domains
  to Azure AD for email addresses to match the organizations domain name. If the organization
  intends to use a third-party identity provider such as ADFS for authentication,
  the added custom domains can be configured as federated. An adversary who has obtained
  privileged access to an Azure AD tenant may leverage this technique to establish
  persistence and be able to authenticate to Azure AD impersonating any user and bypassing
  the requirement to have a valid password and/or perform MFA.

how_to_implement: You must install the latest version of Splunk Add-on for Microsoft
  Cloud Services from Splunkbase (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3110/#/details).
  You must be ingesting Azure Active Directory events into your Splunk environment.
  Specifically, this analytic leverages the AuditLogs log category.
known_false_positives: In most organizations, domain federation settings will be updated
  infrequently. Filter as needed.
