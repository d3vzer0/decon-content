description: This analytic identifies AWS `DeleteTrail` events within CloudTrail logs.
  Adversaries often try to impair their target's defenses by stopping their malicious
  activity from being logged, so that they may operate with stealth and avoid detection.
  When the adversary has the right type of permissions in the compromised AWS environment,
  they may delete the the entire cloudtrail that is logging activities in the environment.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format. 
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that an AWS admin has stopped cloudTrail logging. Please investigate this activity.
