description: This analytic looks for several delete specific API calls made to AWS
  Security Services like CloudWatch, GuardDuty and Web Application Firewalls. These
  API calls are often leveraged by adversaries to weaken existing security defenses
  by deleting logging configurations in the CloudWatch alarm, delete a set of detectors
  from your Guardduty environment or simply delete a bunch of CloudWatch alarms to
  remain stealthy and avoid detection.

how_to_implement: You must install Splunk Add-On for AWS Version v7.0.0 (https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/1876) that includes includes a merge of all the capabilities of the Splunk Add-on for Amazon Security Lake. This search works with Amazon Security Lake logs which are parsed in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework (OCSF)format. 
known_false_positives: While this search has no known false positives, it is possible
  that it is a legitimate admin activity. Please consider filtering out these noisy
  events using userAgent, user_arn field names.
