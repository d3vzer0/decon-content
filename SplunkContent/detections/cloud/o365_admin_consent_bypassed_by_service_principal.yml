description: This detection targets situations where a service principal in Office 365 Azure Active Directory assigns app roles without the standard admin consent, a potential security breach. Using o365_management_activity logs, it examines the 'Add app role assignment to service principal' operation, focusing on service principals and extracting details like role ID and description. This is critical for SOCs to detect potential bypassing of crucial administrative controls, which could lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation. A true positive implies a service principal might be misusing automated processes to assign sensitive permissions.

how_to_implement: You must install the Splunk Microsoft Office 365 Add-on and ingest Office 365 management activity events.
known_false_positives: Service Principals are sometimes configured to legitimately bypass the consent process for purposes of automation. Filter as needed.
